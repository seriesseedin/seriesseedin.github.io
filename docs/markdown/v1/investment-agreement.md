##8. FURTHER ISSUANCE 

8.1 The Company and the Founders shall not provide any Person with rights in relation to the Company which are more favourable than those provided or proposed to be provided to the Investors under this Agreement or the Articles without Lead Investor’s prior written consent and if such consent is granted, it shall be deemed that the more favourable terms, at the option of the Lead Investor, shall apply to the Shares as well. 

8.2 In the event the Company is desirous of issuing any new Shares after Closing, including by way of a preferential allotment (`“Proposed Issuance”`), the Company shall provide and the Founders shall cause the Company to provide, a right of first refusal to the Investors (represented by the Lead Investor) to participate on a pro­rated basis (based on the shareholding computed on a Fully Diluted Basis) in any such Proposed Issuance.

Any such Proposed Issuance in favour of the Investors shall be completed within a period of sixty (60) days after the receipt of the Offered Terms by the Founders, failing which the Company shall have the right to make the Proposed Issuance in favour of the Person specified in the Offered Terms. 

8.5 If the Lead Investor has agreed to participate in the Proposed Issuance, each Investor shall have the right to subscribe to such portion of the Proposed Issuance as shall be necessary for such Investor and the Founders, as the case may be, to maintain their respective shareholding percentage in the Company (calculated on a Fully Diluted Basis), and shall cooperate with the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated herein within the stipulated time period. All Shares issued in the Proposed Issuance shall be issued contemporaneously. 

8.6 Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees that if any person wishes to be registered as a holder of any shares (whether upon transfer or transmission or by issue) (`"New Shareholder"`), the New Shareholder must, unless he is already a party to this Agreement, deliver an executed Deed of Adherence in favour of all the other parties to this Agreement. 

8.7 Each of the Founders and the Other Shareholders covenants with and undertakes to the Investors and the Company that, he/she shall not, without obtaining prior consent of the Lead Investor, dispose or permit the disposal of any interest in or creating of any Encumbrance over the shares in the Company which are registered in his/her name.

9.3.2 The Lead Investor shall, within 30 (thirty) days of receiving the Sale Notice, give written notice (the `“Tag­Along Notice”`) to the Transferring Shareholder stating their acceptance to participate in such proposed Transfer and specifying the number of Tag Shares proposed to be Transferred by them. 

9.3.3 In respect of the Lead Investor giving the Transferring Shareholder a timely Tag­Along Notice, the Transferring Shareholder shall cause the prospective transferee to agree to acquire the Tag Shares identified in such Tag­Along Notice that are given to the Transferring Shareholder, at the same price and upon the same terms and conditions as applicable to the Transferring Shareholder's Shares (save and except that the Investors shall not be required to give any representations or warranties save and except as to their full rights and title to its shares). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or elsewhere, no equity shares shall be Transferred by the Transferring Shareholder until the prospective transferee acquires all Tag Shares (calculated on a proportionate basis to the Transferring Shareholder’s Shares) identified in all Tag­Along Notices. 

9.3.4 To the extent that the Lead Investor does not elect to participate in the Transfer that is subject of the Sale Notice, the Transferring Shareholder may enter into an agreement providing for the closing of the Transfer of such Offer Shares covered by the Sale Notice on terms and conditions that are the same as those described in the Sale Notice. 

9.4 The Equity Shares held by Founders shall be subject to a vesting schedule as follows: (a) 25% of the Equity Shares held by each Founder shall vest immediately at Closing; and (b) the balance 75% shall vest on a monthly basis over a period of 3 (three) years after Closing.

The vested Equity Shares held by Founder on the Founder Termination Date may continue to be held by the Founder but subject to the terms of this Agreement. 

9.5 If any of the shareholders Transfer any Equity Shares in the Company to a third party, then such third party buyer shall execute a deed of adherence in a form and manner acceptable to a majority of the Company’s shareholders. The shareholders shall not Transfer the Equity Shares to a competitor of the Company’s Business (such determination to be made by the Founders and communicated with reasoning when requested by the Lead Investor). 

##10. LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE 

10.1 On the occurrence of an Exit Event, the total proceeds from such an Exit Event remaining after discharging or making provision for discharging the liabilities of the Company, shall be distributed first to the Investors, who shall be entitled to receive before any return to holders of Equity Shares, a `“Liquidation Preference”` equal to the sum of: (i) 1x (i.e. one time) the subscription amount invested by such Investor; and (ii) pro rata portion of the remaining proceeds from the Exit Event (calculated on a fully diluted basis) as distributed to all shareholders of the Company.

##15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION 

15.1 If any dispute arises between any of the Parties hereto during the subsistence or thereafter, in connection with the validity, interpretation, implementation or alleged breach of any provision of this Agreement or regarding any question, including the question as to whether the termination of this Agreement by any Party hereto has been legitimate, the Parties hereto shall endeavour to settle such dispute amicably. The attempt to bring about an amicable settlement is considered to have failed as soon as one of the Parties hereto, after reasonable attempts, which attempt shall continue for not less than 15 (fifteen) days, gives 15 (fifteen) days notice thereof to the other Party in writing. 

15.2 In case of such failure, the dispute shall be referred to a sole arbitrator. The arbitration proceedings shall be governed by the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
